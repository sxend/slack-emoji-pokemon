# Slack Emoji Pokémon (日本語名ローマ字版)

This project works best with [lambtron/emojipacks](https://github.com/lambtron/emojipacks). No need to clone, just use the raw URLs for YAML files.

## Usage

When prompted for Path or URL of Emoji YAML file enter either of the urls below. The prefix url is advised as it prefixes `pokemon-` to every name.

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sxend/slack-emoji-pokemon/master/pokemon.yaml
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sxend/slack-emoji-pokemon/master/pokemon-prefix.yaml
```

Or the less recommended approach is to upload each by hand from the `emojis` folder.

## Want to say Thanks

It's as simple as hitting the :star: Star :star: button.
